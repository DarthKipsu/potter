Prototype 1
===========

This was the first prototype for the main body of the robot. The biggest problem was that the motors together with the cardboard parts were not strong enough to maintain balance for the body when moving, even after installing reinforcement cardboard for the legs. The leg movement when the robot received help to keep it balanced seemed to work for simple walking, but a more stable structure for the body is needed for the robot to be able to move without assistance.

Another observation made was that the digital tilt sensor used to find out if the robot has fallen or not was not enough to tell the robot how it's doing alone. The sensor is too sensitive to movement and says the body is tilted almost all the time though it would be mostly stable.

Model stability is good when standing but movement collapses the build too easily.
